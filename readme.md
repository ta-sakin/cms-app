## Complaints Classification and Management System.

<hr>

This project is mainly build for a city corporation to make citizens complaints submission and resolution process a little bit easier. We have created a **client** side where citizen can submit, update complaints and check thier and other peoples complaint status.

<b>Client site</b> - [https://cms-app-9ed7b.web.app](https://cms-app-9ed7b.web.app)
<br>

An **admin** side with a dashboard for each of the 41 wards' councillor to manage and assign complaints.

<b>Admin site</b> - [https://ccc-admin.netlify.app](https://ccc-admin.netlify.app)(check [admin_creds.txt](https://github.com/ta-sakin/cms-app/blob/main/admin_creds.txt) for admin credentials.)

<b>Server</b> - A shared nodejs server for <b>client</b> and <b>admin</b>.
